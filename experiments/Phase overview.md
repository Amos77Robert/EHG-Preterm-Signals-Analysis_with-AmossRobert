The first phase went through the EHG signal data exploration
Results have been added to the experiments folder
Feature engineering was done by wavelet scattering algorithm
Random Forest Model was tested with 48 recorded EHG signals each with three channels
An accuracy of 52% was achieved. This is far from worse or better considering small size of the dataset
Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Trees and SVM were also tested. 
XGBosst was better than the rest but was less than Random Forest model performance.
More data is need and Phase two will commence
Phase two will involve model fine-tuning and training with large dataset
Deepl Learning approach will also be tested in phase three
