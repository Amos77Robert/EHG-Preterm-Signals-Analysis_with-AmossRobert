1. The first phase went through the EHG signal data exploration.  
2. Results have been added to the experiments folde.r  
3. Feature engineering was done by wavelet scattering algorithm.  
4. Random Forest Model was tested with 48 recorded EHG signals each with three channels.  
5. An accuracy of 52% was achieved. This is far from worse or better considering small size of the dataset.  
6. Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Decision Trees and SVM were also tested.   
7. XGBosst was better than the rest but was less than Random Forest model performance.  
8. More data is need and Phase two will commence.  
9. Phase two will involve model fine-tuning and training with large dataset.
10. Deepl Learning approach will also be tested in phase three.
