# EHG-Preterm-Signals-Analysis_with-AmossRobert
I am exploring preterm birth physiology. Using Electrohysterograph signals from PhysioNet (DOI: https://doi.org/10.13026/zw34-n382), I analyze data with wavelet scattering to extract features for training machine learning models. Outcomes include insights, datasets, and models for further studies and clinical solutions.
