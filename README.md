# Title 
Electrohysterograph (EHG) for Preterm Birth Signal Analysis
# Aim
Seeks to improve interpretability of the recorded physiological EHG signals from pregnant mothers by understanding signal mechanisms which lead to induced and cesarean births.
# Objectives
1). Analyse signals obtained from physionet.org for preterm birth
2). Extract features and perform feature engineering 
3). Experiment with various computational methods to predict preterm birth type
# Disclaimer
This is a personal project driven by curiosity and interest to apply computational intelligence to achieve breakthroughs. It is being conducted during weekends.
# Description
It focuses on tackling the global challenge of preterm births. According to the WHO article from 2023, an estimated 13.4 million babies were born preterm in 2020. The article highlights that complications from preterm birth are the leading cause of death among children under five, accounting for 900,000 deaths worldwide in 2019.

Preterm is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed. Sub-categories include: extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks), very preterm (28 to less than 32 weeks) and moderate to late preterm (32 to 37 weeks).

In Malawi, UNICEF reported that prematurity was responsible for 33% of neonatal deaths in 2015. In 2020, the National Institutes of Health reported that Malawi has the highest rate of preterm births globally, with rates up to 29.7%.

A recent study at the University Medical Center Ljubljana in Slovenia identifies surface EHG as a promising diagnostic tool for non-invasive automated preterm birth prediction(Jager and F, 2023). This small scale project specifically tries to address difficulties in interpreting EHG signals faced by health workers. I will utilize the preterm physiological dataset created at University Medical Center in Slovenia. A machine learning model will be developed to aid in interpretability of the EHG signals in clinical setting.
