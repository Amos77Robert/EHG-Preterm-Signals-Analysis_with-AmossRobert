# Electrohysterograph (EHG) for Preterm Birth Signal Analysis

This is a personal project driven by curiosity. 
It focuses on tackling the global challenge of preterm births. According to the WHO article from 2023, an estimated 13.4 million babies were born preterm in 2020. The article highlights that complications from preterm birth are the leading cause of death among children under five, accounting for 900,000 deaths worldwide in 2019.

Preterm is defined as babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy are completed. Sub-categories include: extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks), very preterm (28 to less than 32 weeks) and moderate to late preterm (32 to 37 weeks).

In Malawi, UNICEF reported that prematurity was responsible for 33% of neonatal deaths in 2015. In 2020, the National Institutes of Health reported that Malawi has the highest rate of preterm births globally, with rates up to 29.7%.

A recent study at the University Medical Center Ljubljana in Slovenia identifies surface EHG as a promising diagnostic tool for non-invasive automated preterm birth prediction. This small scale project specifically tries to address difficulties in interpreting EHG signals faced by health workers. I will utilize the preterm physiological dataset created at University Medical Center in Slovenia. A machine learning model will be developed to aid in interpretability of the EHG signals in clinical setting.

In this weekend carried project, I start with data exploration using data science tools and then extract sample features to understand the physiological mechanisms much better.

The anticipated outcomes include valuable insights, feature-rich datasets, and predictive models that can serve as a foundation for further research and potential clinical trial solutions.

I apply a wavelet scattering technique to understand frequencies in time domain and extract features which will be scaled and prepared for predictive modeling.
